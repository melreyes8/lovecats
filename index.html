    <p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have always loved cats. So now, I might be considered as a crazy cat lady.
    </p>

    <div id="main">
    <p>There are many reasons why I love cats, such as they are so cuuuuuute! (grrrr!), I don't have to walk them outside to do their business, 
        they clean themselves, they are demanding (but they are still cute!), they scatch me (ouch! but they are still cute!), 
        and many other cute stuff cats do.</p>
